# Overview of the statistical analysis:
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:
Key Differences Between June and Dec 
1. June on average is 3 degrees warmer
2. June temps range from 64 - 85, while Dec temps range from 56 - 83. 
3. Examining the standard deviation we conclude that there is less variation in June weather.

## Summary
Both months have a statistically significant number of observations. While December has slightly lower temperatures than June, the weather is still lovely and should not interfere with plans to open a surf and ice cream shop. 

Two additional queries were run to determine the total amount of percipitation each day for both the months of June and December. These queries are confined to 2016, the most recent year where there are records for both relevant months.
